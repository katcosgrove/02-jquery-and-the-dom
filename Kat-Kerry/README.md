# jQuery and the DOM

**Author**: Kat Cosgrove and Kerry Nordstrom
**Version**: 1.2.3

## Overview

We built a blog for the sharing of Bill Murray and cat photos. Its articles update automagically, based on the array of articles in the blogArticles.js file. It is sorted by date from oldest to newest.

## Getting Started

User must create a constructor function, find the appropriate DOM element and add relevant information using key/value reference. User should create succinct for loops to iterate through the rawData set.

## Architecture

We used the jQuery API and a rawData array linked through a second JS file, blogArticles.js. That information was accessed and rendered to the DOM through jQuery methods. Our jQuery is v3.2.1 minified, linked in the HTML file.

## Change Log

10-15-2017 12:00pm: Fixed infinite looping issue
10-15-2017 12:30pm: Traversal and setting of article details in place, refactored for loops into for each
